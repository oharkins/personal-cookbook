    "description": "A one-pan ground beef and potato skillet that's ready in under half an hour? That's right, this cheesy dish is the perfect weeknight comfort food. Note that the recipe is simple tasty as written, but if you want to add some heat, a pinch of cayenne or 1/2 teaspoon of hot sauce is a great addition (add it when you add the paprika). And, my favorite thing to do is to top each portion with a fried egg, or a good dollop of sour cream, or both!",
